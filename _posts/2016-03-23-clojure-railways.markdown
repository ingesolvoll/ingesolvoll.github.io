### The problem

If you ever made a non-trivial single page application (SPA) in JavaScript, you probably ran into some of the same problems as me, namely:

* Functions doing HTTP requests with callbacks aren't easily composable
* Taking error handling seriously pollutes your beautiful happy path code

So let's have a look at a typical JavaScript controller that retrieves data from the server:



{% highlight javascript %}
function loadCustomer(username) {
  $.get('mysite/customer/byusername/' + username).then(function(customer) {
    $.get('mysite/customer/' + customer.id + '/order').then(function(orders) {
        populateCustomerDashboard(customer, orders);
    });
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

You could get quite far with this approach. But it gets messy once you would like to reuse this code chunk but with something else happening in the end, or maybe put the whole thing in a loop after retrieving a bunch of usernames from a server. Using callbacks forces us to explicitly wire things together, making composability possible but far from elegant and natural.

And we did not even get started on the error handling. Here's the same code, with error callbacks:

{% highlight javascript %}
function loadCustomer(username) {
  $.get('mysite/customer/byusername/' + username).then(function(customer) {
    $.get('mysite/customer/' + customer.id + '/order').then(function(orders) {
        populateCustomerDashboard(customer, orders);
    }).error(function(error) {
          // Some proper error handling here
        });
  }).error(function(error) {
    // Some proper error handling here
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Quite quickly, our quite simple logic is buried in deep nesting, duplication and noise. Seeing this, I started looking for solutions that would allow me to:

* Write my asynchronous logic in a clean and linear way, without nesting and callbacks
* Apply robust error handling transparently
* Leverage host language's built in features, avoiding custom made constructs

### Clojurescript and core.async to the rescue

I really like Clojure (script) and after working with it for a while, I got some ideas on how to apply these ideas here. Most of it should be pretty straightforward, as both F# and Clojure have a strong functional approach.

Clojure has the brilliant core.async library that gives us a completely different way of working with time in code. It uses channels for delivering messages between parts of your program. The rest of this post will require some basic understanding of core.async, I recommend this nice and friendly introduction !

We also need a library for doing HTTP. cljs-http leans heavily on core.async. It delivers HTTP responses on channels instead of using callbacks, and is just what we need.

### Tuning in on channels

With cljs-http and core.async, the examples above become:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn load-customer [username]
  (go
    (let [customer (<! (http/get (str "mysite/customer/byusername/" username)))
          orders (<! (http/get (str "mysite/customer/" (:id customer) "/orders")))]
      (populate-customer-dashboard customer orders))))
{% endhighlight %}

Using core.async's go-blocks, we can write our HTTP-requests as a regular procedural code without callbacks, and have all responses available as variables in a flattened scope. Using <! inside a go-block, the library will "park" your program and continue with the next line after a value becomes available. Kind of like a breakpoint in your debugger.

This code still has major issues though.

First of all, a go block returns a channel, so the caller of this function needs to take from that channel to get our customer dashboard. This is ok to some extent, but it's a bit clunky to use channels and go-blocks all over the place. Ideally we would like to have our core logic as pure functions, and use channels to transparently connect them.

Also, the code has the same problem with error handling. Currently there isn't any, and it would be implemented in much the same way as the JavaScript version, with boring and noisy if-checks after receiving responses. And if an error actually occurs, propagating it through your functions will hurt your nice APIs.
